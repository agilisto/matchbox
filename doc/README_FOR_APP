Install Sphinx (Sphinx-0.9.8-rc2 (r1234; Mar 29, 2008))

Create database.yml file based on database.yml.template

rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake ultrasphinx:configure
rake ultrasphinx:index
rake ultrasphinx:daemon:start

Testing Gotchas
+++++++++++++++
Some tests call rake ultrasphinx:index ... but currently,
the ultrasphinx daemon is the same for both dev and testing.
So once you return to developing, you'll need to reindex first,
to avoid wonkiness.
