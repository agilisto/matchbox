Create database.yml file based on database.yml.template
Create production_app_config.yml based on production_app_config.yml.template,
noting how many TLD's there are in the production URL. (so mydomain.com = 1)

rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake ultrasphinx:configure
rake ultrasphinx:index
rake ultrasphinx:daemon:start

rake matchbox:refresh
+++++++++++++++++++++

Needs to be cron'd or run manually.


Testing Gotchas
+++++++++++++++
Some tests call rake ultrasphinx:index ... but currently,
the ultrasphinx daemon is the same for both dev and testing.
So once you return to developing, you'll need to reindex first,
to avoid wonkiness.
